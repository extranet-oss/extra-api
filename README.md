# quick faq for newcomers

- ***extranet/extra-api*?**

  *extranet* is essentially a brand new *epitech intranet* built on top of the current one. It is based on a real ~~public~~ protected API (this repo) allowing external services to also exist.

- **What do this code do?**

  This is the heart of *extranet*. The API is like a central hub for the *extranet* data: it links the underlying database to users, integrations or internal services, while protecting it with its authentication system. However it does not crawl the original *intranet* at all, see *extranet/extra-crawler* for this.

- **Why a new repository?**
  
  I simply chose a better organisation in general for the project + I needed to split repos.

- **Why this 'technology'?**

  *feathers.js* allow me to master the API in a better way than the older *POC-era python api* + it has realtime events over *socket.io*!

- **Can I contribute?**

  Do it. This time it is something you can do because you're part of the *javascript promotion*.

- **Do I need to star this once again?**

  *Star. Every. Repo. Give maximum exposure.*
